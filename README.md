# 🔍 Google Hacking (Google Dorking)

Google Hacking (also known as **Google Dorking**) is a powerful technique that uses advanced Google search operators to uncover sensitive or hidden information that is publicly accessible but not easily found via standard queries. This method is commonly used in **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** and **ethical hacking**.

## 🧠 How Google Hacking Works

Google indexes a lot more than just webpages. With special search operators, you can query:

- Specific file types (`filetype:pdf`, `filetype:xls`)
- Specific sites or domains (`site:example.com`)
- URLs with certain patterns (`inurl:admin`, `inurl:login`)
- Page titles (`intitle:index of`)
- And more...

> Example:
```bash
intitle:"index of" inurl:admin
